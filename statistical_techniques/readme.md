This folder contains examples on how to get various key stastical quantities from datasets. This includes imortant quantities like:
- using bootstrap resampling methods to estimate the median uncertainty on a sample WITHOUT measured uncertainties
- using bootstrap resampling methods to estimate the median uncertainty on a sample WITH measured uncertainties
- estimate the p-value to test for the strength of a correlation between two measured quantities
- estimate the strength of a best-fit line between two measured quantities
